## Description

Duration: 1 Month Sprint

hatclub is a PERN stack CRUD app developed while in attendance at Prime Academy's engineering program. An app for hats and hat enthusiasts alike to experience and appreciate each other, hatclub allows everyone to see photos and read descriptions and details of all of the hats posted to hatclub, while users who register and login will have the options to upload their own hats, edit the hats they have already uploaded, and add and remove hats from their favorites collection. What a fun, innocent idea that couldn't possibly go wrong in any way were it to be used by an actual community of humans and hats.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

Node.js
Postgres

### Installation

1. Create a database named prime_app
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. I recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries
3. Open editor of choice and run an npm install
4. Run npm run server in your terminal
5. Run npm run client in your terminal, which will open a new browser tab for hatclub.

## Usage

Create an account and upload photos of hats, along with detailed descriptions ranging from the physical attributes hat color and hat fabric to the more ethereal hat style and hat vibe. Also there is a spot for just a straight up description. Once you have some uploaded, you can look at them all on the Hats Time page, where you can also add and remove them from the favorhats page. The favorhats page shows a user only hats they have favorited. The Profile page shows a user only the hats they have uploaded, and also allows them to edit the details of a hat or delete it altogether. Good stuff, hat pals!
